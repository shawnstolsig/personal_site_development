        `I grew up travelling the world about a 38' sailboat with my parents and brother. While we didn't have the internet, television, movies, game consoles, or other forms of modern entertainment, we did have a laptop that we used to keep in touch with family back home. To conserve the sailboat's electrical power, my brother and I were alotted one hour of computer usage each day - which we mostly spent playing Flight Simulator. Through this laptop, a passion for computers started for me at a young age, and never went away - I eventually graduated from the US Naval Academy with a degree in Computer Science ('with merit', to boot!). More recently, I've become proficient in web development languages and frameworks through a combination of self-study and a full-stack coding school (PDX Code Guild in Portland, OR). I've always loved the challenge of solving problems through code and I'm excited to pivot my career from operations management to chase the dream of becoming a software developer.`,
        `I'm originally from Seattle but I currently live in Las Vegas with my girlfriend, our three cats, and one lazy (but sweet!) dog. I've picked up a bunch of hobbies over the years; along with many of the usual suspects (music festivals, traveling, computer games, long walks on the beach, etc), I'm passionate about playing/recording music, adventure motorcycle riding, taking photos, tinkering with Arduino and baking sourdough bread.`,
