        `Hi, I'm Shawn. While I'm originally from Seattle, I currently live in Las Vegas with my girlfriend, our three cats, and one lazy (but sweet!) dog.`,
        `I started my coding journey when I was about 9 years old...I had made a friend who was programming his own pong game and I was very intrigued. Admittedly, I didn't make it very far through the Visual Basic tome that my parents bought me shortly thereafter. But a passion for computers stuck with me; I eventually graduated from the US Naval Academy with a degree in Computer Science ('with merit', to boot!). More recently, I've become proficient in web design languages and frameworks through a combination of self-study and a four-month-long, full-stack coding school (PDX Code Guild in Portland, OR). I've always loved the challenge of solving problems through code and I'm excited to have pivoted my career from operations management to software development.`,
        `I've picked up a bunch of hobbies over the years. Along with many of the usual suspects (music festivals, travelling, computer games, long walks on the beach, etc), I'm also passionate about playing/recording music, adventure motorcycle riding, taking photos (I took all the pics on this website), tinkering with Arduino and baking sourdough bread.`,
